# onap

`onap` is a variant of `snap` with support for a custom snap server. It's in beta, but you can daily-drive it. We'll be making it
easier to publish snaps and be adding support for multiple repos.

## Installation
Run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onapcraft/onap/main/install && sudo chmod +x install && sudo bash install` in the terminal after installing `snapd`.

## Upgrading
Run `onap refresh onap` to upgrade `onap` with `onap` (pun intended)
